            Ymir Fritz (ユミル・フリッツ Yumiru Furittsu?) is said to be the founder of the Eldian empire and “the people of
            Ymir” which is the only race of people who can be turned into Titans.
            When she was a young girl, she awakened the power of the Titans and became the first Titan, the Founding
            Titan.
            She was a slave of the Eldian king, who abused her power to bring prosperity to Eldia while devastating
            Marley and the rest of the world.
            Thirteen years after awakening her power, she died protecting the king; her corpse was then forcibly
            cannibalized by their daughters, Maria, Rose, and Sheena.
            Her powers then split into what eventually became known as the Nine Titans.
            Upon her death, Ymir was transported to the Coordinate, where she molded Titans out of the sands and obeyed
            the royal family whenever they sought the Founder's power.</div>

                The Attack Titan (進撃の巨人 Shingeki no Kyojin) was one of the Nine Titans that could see through the
                memories of both its past and its future holders, and has fought for freedom throughout the generations.
                In Eren's possession and acting as his default Titan form, the Attack Titan can receive memories from
                both past inheritors and those yet-to-come, which is described by Zeke Yeager as “the power to transcend
                time.”
                This power actually enabled Eren to paradoxically manipulate his dad Grisha to cause his own Titan
                creation.
                Although these memories allow a glimpse into the future and the lives of those who would inherit the
                Attack Titan subsequently, they are often incomplete, blocking the user from perceiving the larger
                picture
                In terms of appearance, the Attack Titan is 15 meters tall and is characterized by a highly muscular
                build and fleshless jaws.
                It is also interesting to note that the Attack Titan is the only one of the known Nine Titans that has
                not been confirmed to have any unique abilities on its own, but it can be given the hardening ability
                with a specialized serum.

                Also known as Progenitor Titan and the Coordinate, the Founding Titan is the first of all the Titan
                types with the ability to create and control others, modifying the memories and bodies of the Subjects
                of Ymir with its "Coordinate" Ability. Although the Founding Titan is currently in possession of Eren,
                its power can historically only be harnessed by members of the royal family. This Titan possesses
                several abilities, including titan creation and control, memory alteration, and telepathic
                communication.
                The power to command other Titans was unwittingly used by Eren in an attempt to protect Mikasa, while
                anatomical manipulation was used by an Eldian king to make the Subjects of Ymir immune to a rampant
                epidemic. In terms of height, the Founding Titan stands at 13 meters, although it can potentially grow
                taller when its full abilities are tapped. In the War for Paradis Arc, Jean travels to the head of the
                Founding Titan and detonates explosives after wrapping them around its neck, which completely severs off
                the Titan and the Source of all living matter.

                Attack on Titan's War Hammer Titan has powers that allow it to produce and manipulate structures made of
                hardened Titan flesh, weaponizing them in the form of spikes and blades with serrated edges. Theo Magath
                states at one point that while a formidable asset, the War Hammer Titan’s structural hardening should be
                used in moderation, as constant usage can deplete the user of stamina.However, unlike the rest of the
                Nine, the War Hammer Titan can remove its control center from its nape, connecting the Titan and the
                host with a long cable of flesh. The War Hammer Titan can also emerge upon transformation without its
                operator inside its nape, which is a unique ability that the rest of the Nine in Attack on Titan do not
                possess.</div>

                Users of the largest Titan type, the Colossus Titan, can control the energy produced during their
                transformation to create various effects, such as when Bertolt attacks Trost District and his
                transformation triggers a powerful wind blast. The Colossus Titan is also able to create a mushroom
                cloud of dust and rubble, which led to the death of many Survey Corps members during the Battle of
                Shiganshina District. Also, as indicated by its name, the Colossus Titan is known for its enormous size
                and physical prowess, as it holds the ability to topple the outer gate of Wall Maria with a single kick.
                The Colossus Titan also possesses the unique ability to control the steam emitted from its body, burning
                and repelling attacks in proximity in the process. During his final moments in a fight against Armin and
                Mikasa, Eren's Titan form engages in a hand-to-hand fight with the former in his Colossus Titan form.
                While Eren bests Armin in terms of physical and strategic prowess, Armin manages to immobilize him long
                enough for Mikasa to enter his Titan's mouth and kill him before kissing him goodbye.</div>

                Much like the Founding Titan and Zeke’s Beast Titan, the Female Titan is able to exercise a certain
                degree of influence over Pure Titans through a scream-based ability. As the Female Titan can attract
                Pure Titans to itself, Annie Leonhart used this ability to gather Titans on Paradis Island during the
                fall of Attack on Titan's Wall Maria. However, this attraction ability has its disadvantages: once
                arriving near the Female Titan, the others tend to attack and eat its body, which can be countered with
                vertical maneuvering equipment.
                The Female Titan is also known for its tremendous endurance and mobility and can harden its skin at will
                in order to shatter blades of ultrahard steel upon contact. Interestingly, Annie can also come out of
                her Titan’s nape to create a hardened crystal cocoon around herself for protective purposes. During the
                57th Exterior Scouting Mission Arc, Mikasa succeeds in slicing the Female Titan's fingers off, allowing
                Eren to rip the Titan form apart, although he had begun to merge before Levi stops him and stops the
                process.</div>

                Taking on a beast-like appearance, the Beast Titan is slightly larger than most and exhibits animal
                traits that depend upon the user. The Beast Titan is known to have displayed traits common in elks,
                birds, bulls, and wolves among others, as shown in Attack on Titan's Season 2 opening, while Zeke
                Yeager’s Titan assumed ape-like form. It is also interesting to know that Zeke’s spinal fluid was used
                to transform Falco into a Titan, which later gave his Jaw Titan falcon-like epithets similar to that of
                the Beast Titan.
                Possessing greater endurance levels than Pure Titans and other members of the Nine Titans, the Cart
                Titan can partake in longer missions without having to pause for rest. This Titan’s absorption
                resistance allows it to maintain its beastly form and wear armaments such as battle armor, mobile
                machine gun platforms, and cargo packs.
                As opposed to most bipedal Titans, the Cart Titan assumes a quadrupedal form, which potentially hinders
                the user to walk upright in human form. In terms of weaknesses, the Cart Titan has lower defenses and
                slower regenerative abilities as opposed to the others, and more likely to be taken down by a fatal
                blow. However, similar to the Jaw Titan, the Cart Titan possesses immense speed, such as when it
                defeated Zeke and Reiner during the Battle of Shiganshina while catching a member of Attack on Titan's
                strongest family Levi off guard.</div>

            <h3>Armored Titan</h3>
            <p>

                Reiner Braun’s Armored Titan stands at 15 meters and has a slight resemblance to WWE Superstar Brock
                Lesnar. In terms of appearance, the Armored Titan has thick, hardened plates all over its body, acting
                as a natural defense against external attacks including cannon hits, steel blades, and vertical
                maneuvering equipment, making it the most defensively strong of the Titan types. In addition to this,
                these AoT Titans are able to harden their arms and feet, creating sharp claws in the process.
                The Armored Titan's only weakness seems to be the areas on the back of its joint that are armorless in
                nature and the fact that the armor is not capable of withstanding high-power weaponry, such as the
                Mid-East Allied Forces’ artillery. In the end, during the War for Paradis arc, Reiner's Armored Titan
                form is dissipated after all Eldian Pure Titans are transformed back into people.

            <h3>Jaw Titan</h3>

                As indicated by its name, the Titan type called the Jaw Titan possesses a powerful set of jaws that can
                tear through almost anything with incredible ease, even if it is considered to be the weakest of Attack
                on Titan's Titan Shifters. Currently in possession of Falco, the Jaw Titan can move fast enough to catch
                some of the Nine off-guard and cause severe damage to armored opponents by crushing them between its
                jaws. Those who held the power of the Jaw Titan demonstrated an incredible amount of speed and agility,
                especially in terrains such as Titan Forests, even to the point of catching some of the other Nine
                Titans off guard.However, the jaw manifests in slightly varying forms with respect to different users,
                such as Ymir only having hardened teeth, while Falco and Marcel's sport hardened, armored masks and jaw
                plating that is almost bulletproof. Also, Falco’s Jaw Titan has the ability to sprout wings and a tail,
                allowing it to take flight whilst carrying people on its body.</div>

                the Beast Titan.
                Moreover, Zeke’s Beast Titan possessed the formidable ability to throw objects with great accuracy and
                destructive capability, notably during the battle of Shiganshina District wherein most of the Survey
                Corps was wiped out with crushed rocks. Also, due to his royal blood, Zeke’s Beast Titan held the
                ability to turn Subjects of Ymir into Pure Titans.</div>
